  								<p class="f-4 larg-3">Your fat cells are busy chatting away…</p>
  								<p class="f-4 larg-3">And depending on how that conversation is going…</p>
  								<p class="f-4 larg-3">It’s either putting your body into a fat-burning mode…</p>
  								<p>Where your metabolism is flying, you’ve got tons of energy, and you rarely suffer from uncontrollable food cravings….</p>
  								<p>Or it’s putting your body into a fat-storing mode…</p>
  								<p>Where, despite your best efforts at eating healthy and hitting the gym regularly…</p>
  								<p class="f-4">Fat seems to just stay stuck to certain parts of your body…</p>
  							</div>

  							<div class="white-area">

  								<p>And you’re frequently hungry, with late-night-snack-cravings that seem impossible to control.  </p>
  								<p>Now if the first thought that races through your mind when you hear all this is:</p>
  								<p class="f-3 text-center larg-2"> “I never struggle with my weight, everything is so easy!”…</p>
  								<p>Then it probably means your fat cells are already having the right conversation…</p>

  								<h2 class="no-upper text-center red">But if you’re like a lot of the people I talk to…</h2>
  								<p>And you sometimes feel frustrated or even embarrassed by your weight…</p>
  								<p>Or it feels like you’re always losing the same 10 pounds over-and-over-again…</p>
  								<p>And that your stomach, hips, and waistline are like flesh-colored yo-yos…</p>
  								<p>That are constantly going up-and-down in size…</p>

  								<p class="f-4">You see, what I want to share with you today…</p>
  								<p>Is a way to fundamentally transform your body’s relationship with fat…</p>
  								<p>So that instead of letting those fat cells continue to gather together inside your body…</p>
  								<p>Your body starts EVICTING them like a heartless landlord…</p>
  							</div>

  							<div class="white-area">
  								<h2 class="no-upper text-center">Plus as you’re going to see on this page…</h2>
  								<p>It could also help to stop the storage of new fat too…</p>
  								<p>Which means not only is this something that could help you to burn the fat you already have…</p>
  								<p>It may help you to keep that fat off for the long-run as well.   </p>
  								<p class="f-4 text-center larg">Before we continue though, I do want to acknowledge the big elephant that’s in the room…</p>

  								<p>Especially if you’ve tried more diets than you can count on all your fingers and toes…</p>

  								<p>Men and women who are way smarter than me…</p>
  								<p>And whose research is what led to this truly revolutionary discovery…</p>
  								<p>Something that changes the conversation that’s happening between your fat cells…</p>

  								<p>And it’s NOT a diet plan, a workout video, or anything else you’re thinking of either.  </p>
  								<p class="f-4 larg">Instead…</p>
  								<p>This discovery is all about how your body, and your fat cells, communicate. </p>
  								<p>Because like I mentioned at the beginning of this video…</p>
  								<p>As weird as it may seem, your fat cells are talking to each other constantly. </p>
  								<p class="f-4">And new research out of Harvard has found that your fat cells talk with other organs in our body too. </p>
  							</div>

  							<div class="white-area last">
  								<p class="f-4 larg text-center">Now generally, when your fat cells are talking to one another…</p>
  								<p>They are only saying one of two things…</p>
  								<p>Either they are saying: “let’s keep holding onto this fat inside of us…”</p>
  								<p class="f-4">Or they are saying: “we need energy, let’s burn this fat NOW.” </p>
  								<h2 class="no-upper text-center h2-large-2 red">HOLD or BURN…</h2>
  								<p>That’s the language of your fat cells. </p>
  								<p>And here’s the thing…</p>
  								<p class="f-4">The “default mode” for your fat cells is typically to HOLD fat...</p>
  								<p>Not to BURN it.  </p>
  								<div class="text-center">
  									<img src="img/img-8.jpg" alt="" class="center-image bdr">
  								</div>
  								<p class="f-4">Why?</p>
  								<p>It’s pretty simple biology…</p>
  								<p>Our bodies were designed to store fat…</p>
  								<p>So that it’s available in an emergency…</p>
  								<p class="f-4 larg text-center">And for most of human history, this was actually a good strategy for two major reasons: </p>
  							</div>

  							<div class="darg-area drag-area-1">
  								<h2 class="text-center">First, food was often scarce. </h2>
  								<p>Hunters and gatherers might have no problem finding food during a warm spring month…</p>
  								<p>But then spend several months starving during a harsh winter... </p>
  								<p>So to protect us against the uncertainty of when our next meal was coming…</p>
  								<p>Our bodies would store as much fat as possible during the good times…</p>
  								<p>That way we could burn through it during the hard times.</p>
  							</div>

  							<div class="white-area">
  								<h2 class="no-upper text-center"><small>And the second reason</small> our fat cells’ “default mode” is to HOLD fat…</h2>
  								<p>Is because for about 95% of human history…</p>
  								<p>We weren’t at the top of the food chain. </p>
  								<p class="f-4">Insulting, I know. </p>
  								<div class="text-center">
  									<img src="img/img-9.jpg" alt="" class="center-image bdr">
  								</div>
  								<p class="f-4">But the truth is…</p>
  								<p>We used to be routinely hunted by predators like lions, leopards, and even crocodiles…</p>
  								<p>And when you’re running through the Savannah on a 105 degree day in July…</p>
  								<p>With a majestic-but-terrifyingly-hungry lion hot on your tail…</p>
  								<p>You better have a lot of energy ready to burn…</p>
  								<p>Otherwise, you’re going to end up as some big cat’s human-flavored Meow Mix. </p>
  							</div>

  							<div class="white-area">
  								<h2 class="no-upper text-center"><small>Well thanks to our stores of fat,</small> we did have enough energy…</h2>
  								<p>And the result is that while some of our unlucky ancestors got eaten by predators…</p>
  								<p>Most of them were able to escape…</p>
  								<p>And thank God for that, because otherwise none of us would be here today. </p>
  								<p class="f-4">Of course, here’s the thing…</p>
  								<ul class="styled-list da-list f-2">
			  						<li>
			  							<span class="red"><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i></span> While it used to make sense for our bodies to store as much fat as possible…
			  						</li>
			  						<li>
			  							<span class="red"><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i></span> Nowadays, in 2019, things are a lot different. 
			  						</li>
			  						<li>
			  							<span class="red"><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i></span> We can get food delivered to us on-demand…
			  						</li>
			  						<li>
			  							<span class="red"><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i></span> We have a pantry full of snacks…

			  						</li>
			  					</ul>
			  					<p class="f-4">I’m pretty sure you’re not too worried about being hunted down by a lion anytime soon. </p>
  								
  								<h2 class="no-upper text-center">So on the one hand…</h2>
  								<p>The fact that we’re not at risk of starving or being hunted is great…</p>
  								<p>But on the other hand, it’s got our bodies all screwed up. </p>
  								<p>Because today, we’re storing all of this fat we don’t actually need…</p>
  								<p>Which is one of the main reasons why the obesity rate keeps going up...</p>
  								<p class="f-3 text-center">And why it can feel pretty impossible to get rid of all your excess body fat, <br> no matter how hard you try.  </p>
  								<p>You see, here’s the truth…</p>
  								<p class="f-4">And it’s something most fitness experts will never tell you: </p>

  									<div class="single-items">

  								<p>It’s what your body was designed to do…</p>

  								<p>Because even if you don’t eat carbs…</p>
  								<p>You still need to eat protein…</p>
  								<p class="f-4">And your body just converts that protein into fat instead… </p>
  								<p>Then stores it away for a rainy day.</p>
  								<p>The exception to this is when you get your ratio of fats, carbs, and proteins just absolutely perfect…</p>
  								<p class="f-4">But perfection is pretty freaking hard…</p>
