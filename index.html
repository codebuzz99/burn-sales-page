  								<p>In the past two years, my fitness and nutrition advice has been used by more than 1.2 million men and women in over 150 countries…</p>

  								<p class="f-4 larg-3">Your fat cells are busy chatting away…</p>
  								<p class="f-4 larg-3">And depending on how that conversation is going…</p>
  								<p class="f-4 larg-3">It’s either putting your body into a fat-burning mode…</p>
  								<p>Where your metabolism is flying, you’ve got tons of energy, and you rarely suffer from uncontrollable food cravings….</p>
  								<p>Or it’s putting your body into a fat-storing mode…</p>
  								<p>Where, despite your best efforts at eating healthy and hitting the gym regularly…</p>
  								<p class="f-4">Fat seems to just stay stuck to certain parts of your body…</p>
  							</div>

  							<div class="white-area">
  								<h2 class="no-upper text-center">You feel exhausted way too often…</h2>
  								<p>And you’re frequently hungry, with late-night-snack-cravings that seem impossible to control.  </p>
  								<p>Now if the first thought that races through your mind when you hear all this is:</p>
  								<p class="f-3 text-center larg-2"> “I never struggle with my weight, everything is so easy!”…</p>
  								<p>Then it probably means your fat cells are already having the right conversation…</p>
  								<p class="f-4">And that’s awesome, you can go ahead and leave this page right now. </p>
  								<h2 class="no-upper text-center red">But if you’re like a lot of the people I talk to…</h2>
  								<p>And you sometimes feel frustrated or even embarrassed by your weight…</p>
  								<p>Or it feels like you’re always losing the same 10 pounds over-and-over-again…</p>
  								<p>And that your stomach, hips, and waistline are like flesh-colored yo-yos…</p>
  								<p>That are constantly going up-and-down in size…</p>

  								<p class="f-4">You see, what I want to share with you today…</p>
  								<p>Is a way to fundamentally transform your body’s relationship with fat…</p>
  								<p>So that instead of letting those fat cells continue to gather together inside your body…</p>
  								<p>Your body starts EVICTING them like a heartless landlord…</p>
  							</div>

  							<div class="white-area">
  								<h2 class="no-upper text-center">Plus as you’re going to see on this page…</h2>
  								<p>It could also help to stop the storage of new fat too…</p>
  								<p>Which means not only is this something that could help you to burn the fat you already have…</p>
  								<p>It may help you to keep that fat off for the long-run as well.   </p>
  								<p class="f-4 text-center larg">Before we continue though, I do want to acknowledge the big elephant that’s in the room…</p>

  								<p>If you’ve been struggling to control your weight for any significant amount of time now…</p>
  								<p>Then this might all be sounding a little too good to be true…</p>
  								<p>Especially if you’ve tried more diets than you can count on all your fingers and toes…</p>
  								<p>Or if you think you’ve seen it all when it comes to your body, and the way it burns fat.</p>

  								<p>Men and women who are way smarter than me…</p>

  								<p>Something that changes the conversation that’s happening between your fat cells…</p>

  								<p>And it’s NOT a diet plan, a workout video, or anything else you’re thinking of either.  </p>
  								<p class="f-4 larg">Instead…</p>
  								<p>This discovery is all about how your body, and your fat cells, communicate. </p>
  								<p>Because like I mentioned at the beginning of this video…</p>
  								<p>As weird as it may seem, your fat cells are talking to each other constantly. </p>
  								<p class="f-4">And new research out of Harvard has found that your fat cells talk with other organs in our body too. </p>
  							</div>

  							<div class="white-area last">
  								<p class="f-4 larg text-center">Now generally, when your fat cells are talking to one another…</p>
  								<p>They are only saying one of two things…</p>
  								<p>Either they are saying: “let’s keep holding onto this fat inside of us…”</p>
  								<p class="f-4">Or they are saying: “we need energy, let’s burn this fat NOW.” </p>
  								<h2 class="no-upper text-center h2-larg-2 red">HOLD or BURN…</h2>
  								<p>That’s the language of your fat cells. </p>
  								<p>And here’s the thing…</p>
  								<p class="f-4">The “default mode” for your fat cells is typically to HOLD fat...</p>
  								<p>Not to BURN it.  </p>
  								<div class="text-center">
  									<img src="img/img-8.jpg" alt="" class="center-image bdr">
  								</div>
  								<p class="f-4">Why?</p>
  								<p>It’s pretty simple biology…</p>
  								<p>Our bodies were designed to store fat…</p>
  								<p>So that it’s available in an emergency…</p>
  								<p class="f-4 larg text-center">And for most of human history, this was actually a good strategy for two major reasons: </p>
  							</div>

  							<div class="darg-area drag-area-1">
  								<h2 class="text-center">First, food was often scarce. </h2>
  								<p>Hunters and gatherers might have no problem finding food during a warm spring month…</p>
  								<p>But then spend several months starving during a harsh winter... </p>
  								<p>So to protect us against the uncertainty of when our next meal was coming…</p>
  								<p>Our bodies would store as much fat as possible during the good times…</p>
  								<p>That way we could burn through it during the hard times.</p>
  							</div>

  							<div class="white-area">
  								<h2 class="no-upper text-center"><small>And the second reason</small> our fat cells’ “default mode” is to HOLD fat…</h2>
  								<p>Is because for about 95% of human history…</p>
  								<p>We weren’t at the top of the food chain. </p>
  								<p class="f-4">Insulting, I know. </p>
  								<div class="text-center">
  									<img src="img/img-9.jpg" alt="" class="center-image bdr">
  								</div>
  								<p class="f-4">But the truth is…</p>
  								<p>We used to be routinely hunted by predators like lions, leopards, and even crocodiles…</p>
  								<p>And when you’re running through the Savannah on a 105 degree day in July…</p>
  								<p>With a majestic-but-terrifyingly-hungry lion hot on your tail…</p>
  								<p>You better have a lot of energy ready to burn…</p>
  								<p>Otherwise, you’re going to end up as some big cat’s human-flavored Meow Mix. </p>
  							</div>

  							<div class="white-area">
  								<h2 class="no-upper text-center"><small>Well thanks to our stores of fat,</small> we did have enough energy…</h2>
  								<p>And the result is that while some of our unlucky ancestors got eaten by predators…</p>
  								<p>Most of them were able to escape…</p>
  								<p>And thank God for that, because otherwise none of us would be here today. </p>
  								<p class="f-4">Of course, here’s the thing…</p>
  								<ul class="styled-list da-list f-2">
			  						<li>
			  							<span class="red"><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i></span> While it used to make sense for our bodies to store as much fat as possible…
			  						</li>
			  						<li>
			  							<span class="red"><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i></span> Nowadays, in 2019, things are a lot different. 
			  						</li>
			  						<li>
			  							<span class="red"><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i></span> We can get food delivered to us on-demand…
			  						</li>
			  						<li>
			  							<span class="red"><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i></span> We have a pantry full of snacks…

			  						</li>
			  					</ul>
			  					<p class="f-4">I’m pretty sure you’re not too worried about being hunted down by a lion anytime soon. </p>
  								
  								<h2 class="no-upper text-center">So on the one hand…</h2>
  								<p>The fact that we’re not at risk of starving or being hunted is great…</p>
  								<p>But on the other hand, it’s got our bodies all screwed up. </p>
  								<p>Because today, we’re storing all of this fat we don’t actually need…</p>
  								<p>Which is one of the main reasons why the obesity rate keeps going up...</p>
  								<p class="f-3 text-center">And why it can feel pretty impossible to get rid of all your excess body fat, <br> no matter how hard you try.  </p>
  								<p>You see, here’s the truth…</p>
  								<p class="f-4">And it’s something most fitness experts will never tell you: </p>

  								<div class="three-items">
  									<div class="single-items">

  								<p>Because even if you don’t eat carbs…</p>
  								<p>You still need to eat protein…</p>
  								<p class="f-4">And your body just converts that protein into fat instead… </p>
  								<p>Then stores it away for a rainy day.</p>
  								<p>The exception to this is when you get your ratio of fats, carbs, and proteins just absolutely perfect…</p>

	    	<section class="section-2">
  				<div class="container">
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-12 col-lg-10 offset-lg-1">
  							<div class="white-area last">
  								<h2 class="text-center h2-larg-2 no-upper">Hey, still here?</h2>
  								<p class="f-4">No problem, I realize we covered A LOT...</p>
  								<p>So let me go ahead and answer some of the most common questions I get asked about Burn…</p>
  								<p>That way you can make your investment today with 100% confidence.</p>

  								<div class="faq-area">
  									<p class="f-4 larg">1. Are my fat cells really talking to one another? </p>
  									<p>Yep. </p>
  									<p>In fact, every cell in your body communicates with one-another.</p>
  									<p>If you think about it, this makes sense…</p>
  									<p>Because unless your cells were all on the same page…</p>
  									<p>Your body would quite literally fall apart. </p>
  									<p>Well fat cells are no different…</p>
  									<p>And what science has shown us…</p>
  									<p>Is that normally, when your fat cells talk to one-another…</p>
  									<p>They’re telling each-other to keep holding onto the fat that’s inside your belly…</p>
  									<p>So they can save it up for a rainy day.</p>
  								</div>

  								<div class="faq-area">
  									<p class="f-4 larg">2. How does Burn change what my fat cells are saying to one-another?</p>
  									<p>One of the star ingredients of Burn is Capsimax…</p>
  									<p>And Capsimax is a patented, encapsulated, and time-released version of Capsaicin. </p>
  									<p>What makes Capsaicin so special…</p>
  									<p>Is that your body actually has a whole network of receptors inside of it…</p>
  									<p>They’re called TRPV1 Receptors, but they’re also commonly referred to as Capsaicin Receptors too…</p>
  									<p>And research shows that when you take the right dosage of a Capsaicin…</p>
  									<p class="f-4">Like you get in Burn…</p>
  									<p>It activates those TRPV1 Receptors.</p>
  									<p>The reason that matters…</p>
  									<p>Is when your TRPV1 Receptors are activated…</p>
  									<p>They tell your fat cells to start BURNING fat, instead of holding onto it…</p>
  									<p>Which is a pretty amazing breakthrough…</p>
  									<p>Because it means now you can get your body into fat-burning mode without having to hit the gym, or even change what you eat…</p>
  									<p>Although I do of course believe that a healthy diet and exercise are still important for everyone.</p>
  								</div>

  								<div class="faq-area">
  									<p class="f-4 larg">3. What are the ingredients inside Burn again?</p>
  									<p>Burn contains Capsimax, which is the patented version of Capsaicin I just told you about…</p>
  									<p>Paradoxine, which is a special and patented version of the Grains of Paradise Spice…</p>
  									<p>And EGCG, a green tea extract with powerful fat burning potential…</p>
  									<p>Along with Yohimbe, Rauwolscine, and an optimal dosage of caffeine.</p>
  									<p>Plus every single ingredient is included in clinically supported dosages…</p>
  									<p>Which means Burn doesn’t just look pretty…</p>
  									<p>It packs a powerful punch too. </p>
  								</div>

  								<div class="faq-area">
  									<p class="f-4 larg">4. What are the terms of the guarantee again?</p>
  									<p>It’s super straight forward…</p>
  									<p>You have a full 60 Days to order Burn and try it out for yourself…</p>
  									<p>And if you don’t love your experience with this fat-burning breakthrough…</p>
  									<p>Simply call or email my U.S. Based customer support team…</p>
  									<p>And we’ll refund your entire order with no questions asked.</p>
  								</div>

  								<div class="faq-area">
  									<p class="f-4 larg">5. Okay, I’m ready. What now?</p>
  									<p>This is the fun part!</p>
  									<p>Just click on one of the packages below and place your order.</p>
  									<p>You’ll then go to our secure checkout page, where you’ll enter your basic details…</p>
  									<p>And after you’re finished…</p>
  									<p>Your order of Burn will be sent out to you in just 3-5 business days</p>
  									<p>And remember, you’re covered by that 60 Day, 100% Money Back Guarantee too…</p>
  									<p>So there’s really no reason not to go ahead and place your order today…</p>
  									<p>Especially since right now, if you’re on this page, it means we do have some bottles in stock…which isn’t always the case…</p>
  									<p>And because right now we’re offering our biggest discount on Burn ever...</p>
  									<p>But only for a limited time.</p>
